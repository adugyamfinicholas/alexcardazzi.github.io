This homework focuses on a relatively hot topic in the United States: marijuana legalization.  In 1996, California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. Between then and 2010, 14 other states legalized medical marijuana.  Since then, states have begun legalizing recreational marijuana, but that's a topic for another day. One of the arguments against legalizing marijuana is that marijuana and alcohol are complements (which is testable) and traffic safety will reduce by way of increased intoxicated driving (which is also testable). In their 2013 *Journal of Law and Economics* paper titled [Medical Marijuana Laws, Traffic Fatalities, and Alcohol Consumption](https://doi.org/10.1086/668812), Anderson, Hansen, and Rees examine these hypotheses in a difference-in-differences framework. You should read through this paper before completing the Homework.^[The PDF will be made available on Canvas.]

### Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

Summarize the main research question in the paper, the setting analyzed, and why DiD is appropriate for this research question. (**2 Points**)

*Write your answer here.*

### Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

Describe the data analyzed, including general structure of the data set, sources, and the nature of the data.

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. First, read in the [fatalities data](https://alexcardazzi.github.io/econ400/data/fars_state-year.csv) and call it `fars`. (**1 point**)

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Replicate the mean and standard deviation of the total fatality rate in Table 4. *Note*: these are weighted summary statistics. (**1 point**)

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Use Table 1 in [Anderson *et al.* (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1086/668812) to help you create a variable to denote the treatment status for each state in each year.^[You might have to make some judgement calls about which year should be the first year of treatment.  This is what makes research tricky!] (**1 point**)

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Finally, create a variable that measures the time since the MML was passed for each state. Think carefully about how to denote states that are never treated. (**1 point**)

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

### Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

Discuss the general assumptions underlying the causal inference method used in the empirical analysis.

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. How do the authors address these assumptions in the paper (if at all)? (**1 point**)

*Write your answer here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Include a discussion of threats to validity of the results in terms of causal inference. (**1 point**)

*Write your answer here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Since this empirical setting examines a staggered rollout, what do you think about the authors empirical strategy? (**1 point**)

*Write your answer here.*

### Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

Create a figure similar in spirit to Figures 1-3 in the paper. Instead of breaking down the fatality rate by age group as the authors do, just use the total fatality rate supplied in the data. *Note*: these are also weighted numbers.  This is difficult, and you have to read the paper carefully. (**2 points**)

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
# Write your code here
```

### Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

Run a Goodman-Bacon decomposition.^[Do not print the giant output, just the small summary table version.] Interpret the output. (**2 points**)

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

*Write your answer here.*

### Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

Replicate the main result reported in the paper.

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Recreate columns (1) and (2) of Table 6. Note that this is a simple TWFE result.  Be sure to include all the bells and whistles^[See the table notes for the specifics.] sans their controls.  Present the coefficient estimates in a `modelsummary` table. (**1 point**)

```{r, results='hold'}
# Write your code here
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Use the two stage difference-in-differences method in Gardner (2021)^[[Kyle Butts's vignette](https://kylebutts.github.io/did2s/articles/Two-Stage-Difference-in-Differences.html); [Asjad Naqvi's vignette](https://asjadnaqvi.github.io/DiD/docs/code_r/07_did2s_r/)] to re-estimate columns (1) and (2). (**1 point**)

```{r, results='hold', message=FALSE}
# Write your code here
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Estimate event study versions of columns (1) and (2). When plotting, use `xlim = c(-10, 10)`. (**1 point**)

```{r}
# Write your code here
```


`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Estimate event study versions of columns (1) and (2) using Gardner (2021). When plotting, use `xlim = c(-10, 10)`. (**1 point**)

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Using Gardner (2021) and the specification in columns (1) and (2), examine the effect of MMLs on the log of per-capita VMT. (**1 point**)

```{r}
# Write your code here
```



### Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

Discuss the results generated.  What is the interpretation of the causal parameter of interest? Place the causal effect in the context of the setting.

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Compare the TWFE and 2SDiD results for fatalities.  What do you think about the results in Anderson *et al.* (2013)? (**1 point**)

*Write your answer here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Discuss the results for per-capita VMT. (**1 point**)

*Write your answer here.*

### Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

Do you believe the results are credibly causal?  Are the signs and magnitudes plausible? Why or why not? (**1 points**)

*Write your answer here.*
