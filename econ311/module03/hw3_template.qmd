## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

Use these data ([data](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/MASS/cats.csv); [documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/MASS/cats.html)) for the following questions:

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read the data into a data frame called `cats`.  Rename the columns if you find that to be helpful.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Plot the relationship between heart-weight and body-weight (with heart-weight as the x-variable).  Be sure to label the axes and decorate/detail the plot.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Calculate z-scores for the heart-weight variable. Remove observations where heart-weight is outside of three standard deviations from the mean.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Estimate regression models where heart-weight is an explanatory variable and body-weight is the dependent variable.  Estimate each of the following models: level-level, log-level, level-log, and log-log.  Present your coefficient estimates in a table.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Interpret each slope coefficient in words (make sure to include units!).

*Write your response here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Can these coefficients be interpreted as causal?  Explain why or why not.

*Write your response here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. According to the 1st model, how heavy would we expect a cat to be if their heart weighed 14 grams?

```{r}
# Write your response here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. According to the $R^2$, which model does the best at explaining the data?

*Write your response here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Re-run the model with the best $R^2$ for both male and female cats separately.  Test whether the two slope coefficients are statistically different from one another.^[Hint: Check out [this answer on stats.stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/99536)] Interpret your findings.

```{r, results='hold'}
# Write your code here.
```

*Write your response here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Plot the underlying data with the initial regression line, and both gendered regression lines.  Make sure to label your axes and include a legend for the lines.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```





## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

Use these data ([data](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/causaldata/scorecard.csv), [documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/causaldata/scorecard.html)) on colleges and universities for the following question.

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read the data into a data frame called `uni`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Subset the data to only include colleges in VA, MD, and NC that award 4 year degrees.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. For each observation, calculate the "not working" rate (*not* a percentage, so the numbers should be between 0 and 1).  Also, adjust median income so that it is in 1,000's.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Suppose that everyone who graduates makes a decision about whether they want to work that is based on the median income they would earn.  Of course, if the median income is higher, the "not working" rate would decrease.  Run a level-level and level-log regression to estimate this relationship.  Present the coefficients in a table.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Interpret the results in words.

*Write your response here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. A government wants to implement a universal income such that 100\% of the population will choose to work.  Given these results, what would the universal income need to be?

*Write your response here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Do students who graduate from larger universities make more (or less) money?  Estimate the relationship between total earnings ($y$) and the size of student body (in thousands) ($x$). Present the coefficient estimates of a level-level and log-log model in a table.  Interpret the findings including coefficient meanings, statistical significance, and goodness of fit.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

*Write your response here.*

## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

Last module, we simulated some data to explore the central limit theorem (CLT) as it pertained to sample averages.  For this homework, **you** are going to do something similar to see if the CLT applies to coefficient estimates.

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Use the following code to set a sample size and generate random draws from a standard normal distribution: `N <- 3000`, `x <- rnorm(N)`, and `e <- rnorm(N)`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Create a new variable `y` that has the functional form $y_i = 5 + 0.8\times x_i + \epsilon_i$, where $\epsilon_i$ is a random draw from a standard normal distribution.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Now that you've simulated both $x$ and $y$ variables, estimate a regression between them (the coefficients you find should be $\approx$ 5.0 and 0.8). Report the standard error of the *slope* coefficient.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. [When we investigated the CLT for averages](https://alexcardazzi.github.io/econ311/module02/module02-05_notes.html#central-limit-theorem), we randomly drew a set number of observations (with replacement) from the sample.  We chose to select 10 draws out of the 50 states (with replacement), and we did this 10,000 times.  For this question, write a loop that draws 3000 observations (with replacement) 1,000 times.  During each iteration of the loop, collect the regression's slope coefficient estimate.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Compare the standard error calculated by the initial regression (called the "analytical" standard error) to the standard deviation of the regression coefficients (this is called the "bootstrapped" standard error) from the loop.  What does this mean for the CLT and hypothesis testing?

```{r, results='hold'}
# Write your code here.
```

*Write your response here.*
