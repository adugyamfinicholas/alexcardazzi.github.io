## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

What "type" of dataset (e.g. cross section, panel, etc.) are each of the following?  Write your answer in bullet point form:

a. Dataset 1.1:
a. Dataset 1.2:
a. Dataset 1.3:

## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

At this point, both R and RStudio should be downloaded on your personal machine.  Let's set up a file system for this course and make sure you can connect to it via "working directories".

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Name your main folder `econ311`.
`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Inside this folder, make several sub-folders: `homework`, `exams`, `project`, and `scrap`.^[You may create other folders as well, but this is a good start for now.]
`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Inside your homework folder, create yet another sub-folder called `homework1`.^[This is probably a good location to save this file (your answers)!]
`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Open RStudio and in the **open script** (should be `Untitled1`), use `setwd()` to set your working directory to your `econ311` folder.
`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. **In the console**, execute the following code: `list.dirs(recursive = T)`
`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Take a screenshot of what you see.

*Include screenshot here.  Use:* `![folder/path/filename-of-screenshot.png]`


## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

Copy and paste the following vector into R: `vec <- sample(1:100, 10, FALSE)`

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Print `vec` to the console.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Print the first 5 elements of `vec`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Print the last 3 elements of `vec`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Print the 3rd and 8th elements of `vec`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Print the elements of `vec` that are larger than 50.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Print the elements of `vec` that are odd.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```



## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

Read in [Elderton and Pearson's (1910) data on drinking and wages](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/HistData/DrinksWages.csv) using `read.csv()` and save it as `DrinksWages`.^[Note: you can use either the hyperlink's URL *or* you can click on the hyperlink, download the file, and read it in via file path.  If you read it via file path, you should move the file so it is in your `homework1` folder.] ^[[The data documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/HistData/DrinksWages.html) might be important for understanding what each variable means.]

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Print the column names of `DrinksWages`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. What type of measurement (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, or Ratio) is `sober`?  Explain why.

*Write your answer here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. What portion of wages are larger than 30?

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Create a new variable inside `DrinksWages` called `total` that is the sum of `sober` and `drinks`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Create a new variable inside `DrinksWages` called `x` that is `drinks` divided by `total`.  What is an interpretation of `x`?

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Plot `x` on the $X$-axis and wages on the $Y$-axis.  Make each `class` a different color.  Use `pch = 19`.  Label your axes appropriately.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

[This `.pdf` file](https://www.erikthered.com/tutor/historical-average-SAT-scores.pdf) contains SAT scores over time for men and women.  Unfortunately, when I copied it into a `.csv`, the formatting got messed up.

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Recreate the data in [`sat2.csv`](https://alexcardazzi.github.io/econ311/data/sat2.csv) as a `data.frame`.  Rename the year and total math columns (the first one).

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Make a plot where year is on the x-axis and total math is on the y-axis.  Make sure to convert the total math variable to numeric.  Be sure to label the axes.  Color the plot where all years after 1999 are a different color than pre-2000.  Be an *artist*.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Remove the rows where total math is missing.  Also, remove the columns between year and total math, and everything after total math.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```
