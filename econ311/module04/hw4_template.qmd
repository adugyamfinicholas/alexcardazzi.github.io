## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

For this question, you will have to put together two sets of data.  First, you will use college/university statistics from 1995's issue of US News and World Report ([data](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/ISLR/College.csv), [documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/ISLR/College.html)).  Second, you will use earnings data of students from a variety of colleges/universities from College Scorecard ([data](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/causaldata/scorecard.csv), [documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/causaldata/scorecard.html)).

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read in the US News and World Report data.  Save it as a data frame called `usnwr`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read in the College Scorecard data into a data frame called `scorecard`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. The College Scorecard data represents outcomes for students who a) received federal financial aid and b) **began as undergraduates at the institution ten years prior**.  Therefore, College Scorecard data from year $Y$ can be matched to US News and World Report data from $Y-10$.  Unfortunately, the earliest year of Scorecard data is from 2007 while the US News and World Report data is from 1995.  For simplification purposes, merge `earnings_med` from the 2007 Scorecard data **into** the 1995 US News and World Report Data. It might be easiest to eliminate all non-2007 data from `scorecard` before merging.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Generate a summary statistics table for median student earnings, whether the school is private, the acceptance rate, size of the student body, student/faculty ratio, and instructional expenditure per student.  **Note**: you might need to modify/create some of these variables.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Estimate a regression where median student earnings (log) are explained by whether the school is private, the acceptance rate, size of the student body (log), student/faculty ratio, and instructional expenditure per student (log). Display the coefficient estimates (using `summary()` is fine).

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Interpret the coefficients. Can you interpret these results *causally*? Why or why not?

*Write your response here.*


## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

In the early 2000s, two economists ran an experiment where they sent fictitious resumes in response to job ads in Chicago and Boston.  The authors varied the qualities of the fictitious resumes as well as the names on the resumes.  Some resumes were given stereotypically white-sounding names (Emily, Brendan) and others African-American-sounding names (Lakisha, Jamal).^[The process of determining which names are stereotypically black/white is described in detail in [the published draft](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002561).]

In this part of the homework, we are going to investigate whether employers engage in racial discrimination when sifting through resumes using data collected by the researchers ([data](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/AER/ResumeNames.csv); [documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/AER/ResumeNames.html)).^[Intrigued students may read [a non-technical summary of the paper here.](https://www.ala.org/ala/hrdr/placementservice/hrpractice2.pdf) In addition, [similar research on ban-the-box](https://insights.grcglobalgroup.com/ban-the-box-an-effective-component-of-reintegration-efforts/) finds that these policies *increase* racial discrimination.]

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read the data into a data frame called `resume`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Create the following binary variables:
    - A variable called `chicago` that is equal to one if `city` is equal to "chicago" and zero otherwise.
    - A variable called `female` that is equal to one if `gender` is equal to "female" and zero otherwise.
    - A variable called `black` that is equal to one if `ethnicity` is equal to "afam" and zero otherwise.
    - A variable called `callback` equal to one if `call` is equal to "yes" and zero otherwise.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```


`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Estimate and display the coefficients (using `summary()` is fine) of the following regression:

$$\begin{aligned}\text{Callback}_i = \ &\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Jobs}_i + \beta_2 \text{Experience}_i + \beta_3 \text{Female}_i \\&+ \beta_4 \text{Chicago}_i + \beta_5 \text{Black}_i+ \epsilon_i\end{aligned}$$

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Interpret each coefficient in words.

*Write your response here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Can we interpret these results *causally*? Why or why not?

*Write your response here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Estimate and display the coefficients (using `summary()` is fine) of the following regression:

$$\begin{aligned}\text{Callback}_i = \ &\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Jobs}_i + \beta_2 \text{Experience}_i + \beta_3 \text{Female}_i \\&+ \beta_4 \text{Chicago}_i + \beta_5 \text{Black}_i + \beta_6 (\text{Chicago}_i \times \text{Black}_i)+ \epsilon_i\end{aligned}$$

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Interpret the estimates for $\beta_4$, $\beta_5$, and $\beta_6$ from the previous regression.

*Write your response here.*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Re-estimate the regression once using data only from Chicago, and another using data only from Boston.  Report the coefficients using `modelsummary`.  Discuss any coefficients that result in different conclusions for the two cities.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```
